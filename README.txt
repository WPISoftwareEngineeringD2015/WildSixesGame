To run SixesWild simply run the file WildSixesRunner.java

This will open our SplashScreen, and after 2 Seconds you will see our Main Screen.
Clicking play will take you to the SelectScreen. 
Cyan tiles indicate that the given level is unlocked, whereas Blue tiles correspond to locked levels.

Currently, there is an example LevelTemplate being used that generates a bogus level.
You can still look at this level, and click back to return to the SelectScreen.

Pressing X closes the program.
